# 5 Minutes or Less: TypeScript/JavaScript patterns and features

## Patterns and features of TypeScript and JavaScript, demystified in less than 5 minutes each

This is a collection of briefly presented concepts, features, and patterns that I find interesting in TS/JS.

## Content

Current contents:

- TypeScript 5.0 decorators
- Index signatures
- Maps and sets
- Metaprogramming (Reflect API and Proxy)
- Nullish coalescing
- Static factory function
- Utility types:
  - Exclude
  - Omit
  - Parameters

  - Required
  - Return type

## Running the code

You can install the things with `npm install` and then just go at each file with `npx ts-node src/{filename}.ts`.

Or, if you're lazy, you can also copy the individual TS file's contents into the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) if you want to avoid cloning and installing anything at all.
